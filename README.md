# Project Title: Understanding Relational Databases and MySQL Development

## Overview
This project encompasses theoretical understanding and practical application of relational databases using MySQL Workbench and the SQL programming language. The theoretical aspect covers various types of relationships in relational databases and the importance of normalization in database development. The practical aspect includes tasks performed in MySQL Workbench, highlighting database creation, SQL query writing and execution, query debugging, EER (Enhanced Entity-Relationship) diagram creation, understanding relationships, and identifying primary and foreign keys.

## Goals
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Present a theoretical understanding of the different types of relationships in relational databases using examples.
- Explain the concept of normalization and its significance in database development.
- Demonstrate practical tasks in MySQL Workbench, including creating a database, writing and executing SQL queries, debugging SQL queries, creating an EER diagram, understanding relationships, and identifying primary and foreign keys.

## Data Source
The dataset used for practical tasks is titled "World," which contains information on different countries, cities within them, and the languages spoken there.

- **World Dataset:** A file named "World" provides comprehensive information on countries, cities, and languages.

## Tools Used
- **MySQL Workbench:** Utilized for database development, SQL query writing and execution, debugging, and EER diagram creation.
- **SQL Programming Language:** Implemented for database manipulation, query writing, and execution.
- **Microsoft Word:** Used to document the completion of goals set in my assignment

## Repository Contents
1. **Assignment Folder:**
   Here lies my word document containing clear indepth information tied to the goals of the project such as:
   - Types of relationships in relational databases with examples.
   - The importance of normalization in database development.
   - Completion of various tasks within MySQL Workbench using SQL programming language.

2. **SQL Folder:**
   Inside this folder lies the SQL script i used to complete the tasks set in my assignment based around the "World" dataset 
   
3. **Dataset Folder:**
   - **World.csv:** CSV file containing information on countries, cities, and languages.

Feel free to explore the theoretical documents, practical scripts, and the "World" dataset in this repository to gain insights into relational databases, normalization, and practical MySQL development.
